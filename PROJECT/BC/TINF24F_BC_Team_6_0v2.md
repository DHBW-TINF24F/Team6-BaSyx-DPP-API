## Description and Goals

The goal of the project is to develop a **two-sided (Backend-Frontend) implementation of the REST-API Digital Product Passport (DPP)** in accordance with the **DIN EN 18222 standard** within the **BaSyx framework** to ensure standardized lifecycle management and DPP search.

The relevance of this project lies in **improving the DPP search capability** and **increasing service efficiency**. By providing a ready-made backend and frontend product for DIN EN 18222 standards, the project enables companies to implement the necessary digital solutions more quickly.

## Cost Calculation

Calculation of the development cost estimate. The cost estimate is a comprehensive 
plan of all the company´s expenses for the planned period of production and financial 
activity. 

An investor´s cost estimate includes the following main expenses: 
• *Base salary*; 
• *Rent*; 
• *Components*; 
• *Electricity*; 
• *Risk*. 

### Salary Costs

Based on 180 hours per team member (Table 2).

| **Position** | **Salary €/h** | **Cost Total in €** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Project Manager | 35 | 6,300 |
| Product Manager (x2) | 32 | 11,520 |
| Test Manager | 30 | 5,400 |
| System Architect | 30 | 5,400 |
| Technical Writer | 28 | 5,040 |
| UI-Designer | 28 | 5,040 |
| **Total Salary Costs** | **215** | **38,700** |

*Table 2. Salary calculation based on hourly wages.*

### Other Costs

Expenses estimated for the 11-week project duration (Table 3).

| **Expense Type** | **Cost Total in € (11 weeks)** |
| :--- | :---: |
| Consumables (paper pads, toner, pens) | 200 |
| Electricity | 2,400 |
| Rental Costs | 6,750 |
| Internet services and communication costs | 135 |
| Software licenses | 10,000 |
| Training | 1,000 |
| **Total Other Costs** | **20,485** |

*Table 3. Other costs calculation.*

The estimated total cost of developing the software product is:
$$\text{Total Costs} = \text{Salary Costs} + \text{Other Costs}$$
$$\text{Total Costs} = €38,700 + €20,485 = \mathbf{€59,185}$$

## Risks

The team identified the following key risks:

* *Risks associated with a sudden decline* in the project's operating capacity.  
* **Communication risks* (insufficient communication between team members). To 
solve this problem, it was decided to hold regular meetings, use the GitHub and Jira services.
* **Technical risks** (sudden failure of the Internet connection or power supply for an 
extended period of time, unplanned unavailability of equipment).   
* *Risk of ignoring risks* (insufficiently realistic assessment of scenarios by each 
member of the test team). To solve this problem, a list of possible risks and possible 
solutions was created.  
* *Schedule risk*. To address this issue, a detailed project work plan was created and 
progress was systematically monitored. 
* *Budget risks*. Exceeding the planned budget due to additional costs.
